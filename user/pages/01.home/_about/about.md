      subheading: Koh Mook
      body: We've been mostly exploring fairly typical "touristy" spots on our trip with plenty of luxuries and decided that it was time to do some island hopping to the less popular islands of Thailand and get a better feel for the real island life. We're staying in small bungalows near the beach for $10/night.

      body: Realizing that many of the less popular islands are either nearly impossible to get to or are only resort islands and insanely expensive, we have decided just to travel to Ko Lanta for a few days on our way North back to Bangkok before flying to Vietnam.
