We have actually been here a little over a week now but "1 Week Thailand Recap" sounds better than "a week and 2 and a half days recap." Once again I have to apologize to the few people that are actually reading this and been wondering what we've been up to. I would like to tell you all that we've been taking forever to write because we've been too exhausted from all the crazy things we've been up to... but I would be lying. The truth is, since leaving Bangkok and moving North to Chiang Mai (yep that's where we are now), we have just been basking in the wonderful weather and the lack of insanity that was Bangkok. 

The above statement would actually remain truthful for our time in Bangkok however, as we really didn't have much downtime during our stay. That's just the way Bangkok is, there is always something going on or something to see, and in our case, a new hostel/condo to lug your backpack to.

This is going to be pretty long, (TL;DR Bangkok was fun but it wears on you).

##### Recap
1. ##### Landed in Bangkok
* We landed in Bangkok on the first day of the trip and immediately realized that we were way underprepared. From the moment we grabbed our baggage we had no idea where to go or what to do. We went to a little kiosk in the airport and got rigged up with an overpriced phone plan but hey, at least it gave us access to Google Maps so we could have some idea how to get to our condo. We finally found out where and how to get on the Rail Link and then from there it wasn't too hard with the BTS Station and good ol' walking.
2. ##### Moved into Elio Condo
* After some struggling with some serious language barriers with the security guards of the building, we finally got access and were hugely impressed with the place. We intend to do a proper review of what the place was like but for now I'll recap: The room was very small but modern and clean and exactly what we were after. In the courtyard area between the two buildings of the condo sat a beautiful pool with 2 pod-like rooms seemingly sitting on the water. One was a gym and the other was a workspace with tables and wifi. We really enjoyed our stay and wished we didn't have to leave.
3. ##### Dusit Zoo
* On our first full day in Bangkok we decided to go to the Dusit Zoo. It was nice and cheap to get in and was about exactly what you'd expect out of a zoo. We had a really nice time and ended up watching a Kenyan Acrobatic Show. It was insane the kinds of stuff these guys were able to do and luckily Livia managed to catch some on video. It will be included in a video Liv is putting together and will be posting soon.
4. ##### Chatuchak Market
* We had read quite a bit about the Chatuchak Market and decided it would be worth checking out. I don't think anything could have prepared us for this thing. The market was massive and you could find damn near anything there. The market takes up about 3 city blocks and is just endless rows upon rows of merchants selling their stuff. I am positive that you could spend the whole weekend there (it's a weekend market) and not see everything, and even still you wouldn't know if you had. 
5. ##### Moved to Apple Guest House
* We decided it was a good idea to just walk from the last BTS Station to our new hostel (knowing full well that it was a 50 min walk). This was a horrible mistake. Throwing a backpack on in the sweltering 36 degree heat and hiking for an hour should never have seemed like a good idea. Anyways we got to the Apple Guest house alive and were also dumb enough to get the cheaper fan-only room. The place itself was great and in a good location near Khao San road but we eventually gave in and paid the extra for the A.C.
6. ##### Khao San Road
* Khao San road lives up to its reputation, even in the low season when we went. The best way I can describe it is one long street, lined by bars, barely-bars, market stalls, street food carts, and competing music. Then fill it with a few too many people, have somebody pushing a sign in your face for something you don't want every 5 seconds, and the occasional stumbling drunk guy, and you have the Khao San Road experience. I may have painted a very ugly picture of it and in many ways it is; but this is what you expect when you go and somehow it is still a lot of fun. We had 2 nights in the area but we only really went out to Khao San the first night. The second night we opted to explore other dinner options and relaxed.
7. ##### Sleeper Train to Chiang Mai
* We had originally planned to go to Pattaya next, but after being in Bangkok for 6 days (we were called brave for sticking around that long haha) we were ready for a more relaxed area. We decided it was time to go to Chiang Mai. Options for getting there were bus (9-10 hours), plane (1.5 hours), or sleeper train (14 hours). We toyed with the idea of flying since it was barely more expensive but finally decided on the sleeper train. It is something I think everyone who travels through Thailand should try. It was a cool experience getting on the train at 7:30, chatting with others on the train for a few hours, having your seats turned into sleeping pods, and waking up in the morning to watch the lush green Thai countryside fly by. Plus, it means one less night to have to pay for at a hostel.

As for once we reached Chiang Mai, we have mostly just been relaxing. If you are interested in what Chiang Mai has been like for us, check out our post about our experience there so far: [Life in Chiang Mai](https://www.canadianwanderlust.com/blog/life-in-chiang-mai)
