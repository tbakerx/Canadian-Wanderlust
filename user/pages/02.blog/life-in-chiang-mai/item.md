We've been in Chiang Mai for the last few days since leaving Bangkok on the sleeper train. So far it has been great! We made the choice to move over here mostly because we were simply tired of Bangkok, we wanted to escape the hustling, dirty, and cramped conditions that are nearly unavoidable there. And this was the right choice. Aside from the roads that circle the Old City and a few other main ones in the area, Chiang Mai is nice and relaxed with not too much traffic and plenty to do and see. Just outside the city there are endless possibilities for touristy things like hikes, jungle treks, ziplining, etc. but all are very expensive in comparison to the rest of the cost of living here. We intend to take advantage of some of these experiences but for our first few days here we haven't done a whole lot. In fact we have been quite happily unexciting in our first few days here!

#####This has been the general structure of our last few days:

1. #####Wake up whenever we want
* We don't bother with any alarms except our daily Malaria meds reminder. We have already found that we've kind of fallen into a natural sleep rhythm, something I never really felt in Canada. There is no need here to try and squeeze those last few minutes out of your night or any reason to force yourself to get up before you're ready.
2. #####Go find a new coffee shop
* We have been making a point to try and find a new coffee shop each morning. They're everywhere and drinks are so affordable. Hot coffee isn't hard to find here but people who actually drink it are (for obvious reasons). The focus is definitely on Iced Coffees, Teas, Smoothies and fresh fruit juices. For reference, a large Iced Mocha with whipped cream, chocolate drizzle, and sprinkles costs about 40 Baht on average (That's $1.47 CAD).
3. #####Grab food
* Almost everyone in the world already knows everything I'm going to say on this topic but here goes: The food in Thailand is one of the most spectacular parts of the country. It is _everywhere_! You really can't go much of anywhere without seeing a street food cart or little restaurants operating out of anything from a proper restaurant to some guys garage. And it is all so cheap! For example: yesterday we grabbed a bunch of fried chicken from a street cart for lunch. It was enough to fill both of us and it cost a whopping 50 baht! ($1.84 Cad). And we went for a proper dinner and drinks at a really upscale place the other night and in total it cost us 420 baht ($15.42 CAD).
4. #####Explore
* We are currently living right next to Old City in Chiang Mai. It is not a large area, nor too crowded, but it seems endless with things to see. The buildings are densely packed with streets running every direction throughout and more closely resemble small alleyways back in Canada than full-on streets.
5. #####Relax at our hostel
* We still spend more time than we care to admit just relaxing at the hostel on the deck or in the room just reading, doing small workouts, video editing, blogging, and, in my case, coding.
6. #####Find more food
* When we eventually decide that our hunger outweighs our laziness, we go out in search of more food. We tend to make this meal of the day one that we actually look up a restaurant to go and sit down to eat at. It is really satisfying to be in a place where we can actually afford to go out to eat at nice places regularly!
7. #####Find something to do at night
* Pretty much every city in Thailand (I say from a combination of our limited experience and from what I have read) really comes alive at night. This is when whole streets become giant block parties, the street vendors come out in abundance, and night markets are not hard to find. It is never hard to find some way to spend those last few hours before we're ready for bed.

You may be thinking: "How can you be in Thailand and be so damn lazy? Go start doing cool things!" And to that I answer: We are very fortunate to not really be limited by time on this trip. We have planned it in such a way that we can stay about as long as the money lasts. And with that, the more days that we just relax and enjoy the beautiful weather, the longer we can stay :). There is plenty of time to do all the (mostly overpriced) tours and treks in the area and I assure you we will, but for now we don't feel the slightest bit guilty just taking it easy and getting acclimated to the lifestyle.

As it stands right now, we have our place here in Chiang Mai until the 20th of September and are not sure yet whether we will look for another place to stay here for another week or if we are going to head south to tour the islands. We'll have to decide soon!

That's all for now, thanks for reading!
