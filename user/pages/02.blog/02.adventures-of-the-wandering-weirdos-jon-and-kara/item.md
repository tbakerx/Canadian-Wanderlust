#### Please allow me to introduce myself… 

So with a ridiculously long heading like that, it should be clear to you lovely readers that I am not claiming to be the most esteemed of authors… nor I am claiming to be a professional travel agent. So with that being said, make sure to do your own fact checking and research before you travel on your merry way!

Let's start with the basics, my name is Kara. I've been traveling around South East Asia for the last 5 plus months with my wonderful partner Jon. Jon and I recently met Tim and Livia, and I must say they are two pretty cool, down-to-earth Canadians both of whom, raised a very significant point. There are loads of resources, blogs and websites out there for travelers, but not a lot of them are aimed specifically at Canadians. And so began the ingenious idea that grew to be Canadian Wanderlust. 

Dreaming turns into planning and planning turns into doing and if you are in any of these stages you are lucky! If you are traveling as a Canadian then you are extra lucky and I mean this in the least arrogant way. For instance, before I started my travel planning I thought the world was a magic place that you could explore at will, showing up at your destination of choice with not a care in the world. Then I discovered that lots of countries (especially in SEA) require a pre-arranged visa. Canada happens to have many agreements with various countries that make your life a bit easier when applying for these visas. Some places even offer Canadian citizens visas on arrival. Now this next bit is definitely subjective but many people respond positively when they learn Jon and I are from Canada and this has made me feel very welcome in almost every place we've travelled!

Now feel free to close your eyes and head bang a little as you listen to this tune, not because I say so but because you can!
