# Canadian Wanderlust

![Canadian Wanderlust](homepage.png?raw=true "Canadian Wanderlust")

Canadian Wanderlust is Tim Baker and Livia Gut's blog to keep track of our travels throughout Southeast Asia for all of our friends and family back home in Canada. We also intend to write articles designed specifically for Canadians to help share what knowledge we ourselves had to struggle to obtain. We hope to become a valuable resource for other Canadians to satisfy their own wanderlust as painlessly as possible.

Our website is built by me (Tim Baker) on the Grav CMS platform using the Deliver skeleton loosely as a starting point. Grav is a PHP-based flat-file CMS using Twig for templating. I have been using primarily Bootstrap for styling with a little Pure thrown in for fun.
